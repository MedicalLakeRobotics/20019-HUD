UDP MESSAGES
=================
Locations and distances are in ft, but that can be changed.
Orientations are in Degrees CW. 
Bearing To Target is in Degrees CW.
The Orientation for the Target command is the Robots desired orientation at the target.
Angle brackets represent where values need to be substituted, they are not part of the command.
Values are string representations of a number (floating point or integer) - I use String.fprintf("%g").
Time strings are displayed as is, not parsed to a number.
Spaces are fine but not necessary.
Uppercase may also be used.
Messages remain on the screen until overwritten or the clearmsgs command is sent.

target, <x>, <y>, <orientation>          (defines target for path calculation)
calculate, <x>, <y>, <orientation>       (places robot and calculates a path)
position, <x>, <y>, <orientation>        (places robot)
time, <string label e.g. "match">, <time as string>      (displayed at upper left)
